    },
    {
      question: "What's the delivery process like?",

    },
    {
      question: "What's included in a membership?",
      answer: "Memberships include unlimited design requests, unlimited revisions, priority support, faster turnarounds, and access to premium features. Perfect for ongoing design needs and growing startups who need consistent brand development."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is my point of contact?",
      answer: "You'll have a dedicated project manager who will be your main point of contact throughout the process. They'll coordinate with our design team and ensure your project stays on track and meets your expectations."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I'm not happy with the work?",
      answer: "We offer unlimited revisions until you're completely satisfied. If we can't meet your expectations, we provide a full refund. Our goal is 100% satisfaction - we don't succeed unless you do."
